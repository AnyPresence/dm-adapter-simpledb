== 1.1.0 2009-11-24

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Supports legacy (pre-1.0.0) objects
    
    Prior to version 1.0.0 there were some differences in how this adapter
    stored nils and strings containing newlines. The adapter will now detect old
    objects and load them correctly.

  * Adds object versioning

    New records created by the adapter now have version metadata attached to
    them, making it easier to change how objects are stored in the future.

* 1 bug fix
  * Fixed an "odd number of arguments for hash" error when saving objects.

* Cleanup/refactoring
  * Work has begun to start splitting out functionality into separate files and
    classes
  * Added unit tests to complement the existing integration tests

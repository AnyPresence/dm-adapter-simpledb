== 1.4.0 2010-01-24

* Major enhancements:
  * Completely rewritten query generation engine queries supports
    arbitrarily deep nesting of complex AND/OR/NOT operators.  This means that
    code such as:

      Post.all(:title => "foo") | Post.all(:title => "bar", :body => "baz")

    will generate a SELECT statement similar to the following

      SELECT title from mydomain where title = "foo" OR ( title = "bar" AND body = "baz" )

  * New query engine supports range and IN predicates to the extent possible on
    SimpleDB, including converting empty inclusion predicates to a form that
    SimpleDB can understand. Exclusive ranges e.g. (0...5) now raise a
    NotImplementedError instead of being silently flaky.

  * Support for native condition expressions, e.g.:

      Post.all(:conditions => 'title in "%banannas%"')

    This includes support for variable interpolation:

      Post.all(:conditions => ['title = ?', "foo"])

    or:

      post.all(:conditions => ['title = :title', {:title => "foo"}]

    Interpolated values will be quoted according to SimpleDB value quoting
    rules.

  * Support for arbitrarily large limits. The concept of a query limit and a
    batch limit have been completely separated in this release. If the batch
    limit is set to 100 and a query is limited to 201 items, it will generate
    three selects: two with "LIMIT 100" and one with "LIMIT 1".

  * Vastly improved logging and benchmarking. For a given high-level operation,
    such as a DataMapper "read", the adapter can output:
    
    * Number of individual AWS calls made (e.g. individual SELECTs)
    * Aggregate AWS box usage
    * User CPU time
    * System CPU time
    * Wallclock time

* Minor enhancements:
  * Even better quoting. With the new SELECT translator in place, all domain
    names, attribute names, and values should be quoted properly according to
    SimpleDB rules.
  * No direct dependency on RightAws.  All operations are performed via SDBTools
    now.
  * New "batch_limit" option to configure the maximum results requested per
    SELECT call.  Amazon sets a cap of 250 on this value.


== 1.3.0 2010-01-19

* 1 major enhancement:
  * Now supports :offset in queries. Combined with improved :limit support, this
    makes it possible to efficiently paginate result sets.

* 1 minor enhancement:
  * Better quoting of select statements using the 'sdbtools' library.
  * "Null mode" can be set with :null => true. Null mode logs DB operations but
    does not actually connect to AWS.

== 1.2.0 2010-01-13

* 2 minor enhancements:
  * Better support for String attributes with multiple values which were not
    created by the String chunking system.
  * Now tries to take model and repository into account when determining storage
    name for a table.

== 1.1.0 2009-11-24

* 2 major enhancements:
  * Supports legacy (pre-1.0.0) objects
    
    Prior to version 1.0.0 there were some differences in how this adapter
    stored nils and strings containing newlines. The adapter will now detect old
    objects and load them correctly.

  * Adds object versioning

    New records created by the adapter now have version metadata attached to
    them, making it easier to change how objects are stored in the future.

* 1 bug fix
  * Fixed an "odd number of arguments for hash" error when saving objects.

* Cleanup/refactoring
  * Work has begun to start splitting out functionality into separate files and
    classes
  * Added unit tests to complement the existing integration tests
